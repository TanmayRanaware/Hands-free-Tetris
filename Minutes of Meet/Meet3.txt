 The Agenda of the meet :
1) to finalise the fpga board 
              a) Intel or Xilinx
              b) Altera/Artix 7 vs Cyclone/Zynq
(Mainly based on which one will facilitate the ML programming part)
2) Hence, conclude on the software to be used.

3) Finalise the software/open source platform that we shall be using in order to simulate the FPGA - with all the things (ML, OLED/VGA Display and Camera)


Task for Mentees-
-Look which would be more suitable to deploy machine learning code,Artix 7 Vs Zynq 
-Team divided so that one will work on hardware part,one on machine learning code,one on machine learning code and tetris code 

Next meet is scheduled on December 27, 2020
